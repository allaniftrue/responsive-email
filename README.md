When I started creating responsive email templates it was such a pain on my end.  There are so many resources on the www though but mostly are for device specific emails which uses device pixels as break points.  But do we really need such break points?  IMO, yes if you know the devices your audience are using.  If not then specifying your break points one by one would be so timely.  As a hack, we can use a general purpose email templates.
